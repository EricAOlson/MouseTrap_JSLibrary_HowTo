      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <h2>Mousetrap Library</h2>
      <p>Traditionally, most user interaction on web pages is done via the mouse by clicking on buttons, hyperlinks and navigation tools like scroll bars.  This can be fairly limiting depending on the type of web page and user interaction the designer is pursuing.  There are many tools available to expand the user interface to actions taken outside of simple mouse clicks, but most require integration of some more advanced code/tools/interface.  This site will explore a very simple JavaScript library that can allow the site developer to respond to keyboard input directly, bringing WebPages more in line with desktop applications in terms of user interaction options.</p>
      <p>The Mousetrap library was created by Craig Campbell (<a href="https://github.com/ccampbell">ccampbell</a> on Github) in 2012.  It is an OpenSource library shared via Github and available via free download from his site <a href="https://craig.is/killing/mice">https://craig.is/killing/mice</a>.  It's worth noting that while a number of resources were leveraged to gain understanding of the library, much of the information included in this How-To is a consolidation of information presented in Craig's documentation available from the <a href="https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap">Github Repo</a> and website referenced above.</p>
      <p>This site provides a high level introduction to the library and some examples of how the key binding tools work.  This is not a comprehensive review of every feature of the library or an exhaustive list of all the ways the library can be used, but should give you the tools to utilize the library in your future web page builds.</p>
      <p>You can navigate through this How-To via the Previous/Next buttons presented at the bottom of each page or via the directory links provided in the left navigation.</p>
